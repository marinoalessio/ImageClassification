# Image Classification of coins and banknotes using a Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains my first project of Image Classification for the university course "Machine Learning" in Bachelor's Degree.

## Explanation

This project is dedicated to developing a robust CNN-based classification system for distinguishing between various coins and banknotes. With the growing need for automated cash handling systems, this code serves as a valuable resource for building such applications.
